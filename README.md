# Cold Start Problems in Recommender Systems

This repository hosts our research on the cold start problem in recommender systems, focusing on methods to effectively recommend items to new users or items with little historical data.

## Introduction

Recommender systems are critical in helping users discover products, music, or articles aligned with their interests. These systems face challenges when new users or items lack sufficient interaction history, known as the cold start problem. Our research explores various techniques to address this issue, aiming to enhance the accuracy, reduce bias, and improve diversity in recommendations for new entities.

## Methods Explored

We have employed and evaluated several standard and hybrid techniques to tackle the cold start problem:

- **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**: Utilizes user-item interactions to predict user preferences. Variants within CF include:
  - **Memory-Based CF**: 
    - **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: Predicts user preferences based on similarities with other users.
    - **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on similarities with items the user has previously interacted with.
  - **Model-Based CF**: 
    - **Matrix Factorization (MF)**: Decomposes user-item matrices to discover latent factors and predict unseen interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items based on their content features. Techniques used for content vectorization include:
  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Analyzes the importance of words within a collection of documents to understand content significance and similarity.
  - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Utilizes deep learning to capture contextual information of text for a more nuanced understanding and matching of content.
- **Hybrid Methods**: Combines multiple recommendation techniques to leverage their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses.

## Dataset

Experiments were conducted using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), which includes 100,000 ratings from 600 users on 9,000 movies. The dataset provides a rich source of user ratings, movie metadata, and user-generated tags.

## Experiments

Our experimental setup is designed to simulate real-world scenarios where new users or items are introduced. We assess the performance of various recommendation strategies, including:

- User-based Collaborative Filtering
- Matrix Factorization
- Content-Based (TF/IDF) + Matrix Factorization
- Content-Based (BERT) + User-based Collaborative Filtering

## Results

The experiments highlight the effectiveness of hybrid models in dealing with the cold start problem. These models not only provide more accurate recommendations but also show robustness in scenarios with sparse data.

## Conclusion

The findings suggest that hybrid recommender systems, which integrate multiple recommendation techniques, can effectively mitigate the cold start problem. This approach enhances the system's ability to provide relevant and diverse recommendations to new users or for new items.

## Future Work

- **Testing with Larger Datasets**: Expanding tests to larger datasets like the Netflix Prize dataset or more extensive MovieLens datasets to validate the models' robustness and adaptability.
- **Incorporating More Complex Hybrid Methods**: Exploring sophisticated hybrid models and advanced NLP algorithms to better integrate genre and tag information.
- **Using Advanced Deep Learning Techniques**: Integrating advanced deep-learning methods into hybrid models to further improve predictive performance and tackle the cold start problem.
